# Notes App

A minimal full-stack demo app built to explore modern serverless tooling - Next.js on Vercel for the frontend, Supabase for authentication and data storage, Trigger.dev for background jobs, and Resend for automated transactional emails.

This project is intentionally small in scope, focused on wiring together these services end-to-end.
